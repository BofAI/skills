# X/Twitter Digest

## Overview

Use this skill to produce a concise Chinese daily digest from the user's own X/Twitter account. The recommended entry point is `scripts/run_daily_digest.py`, which selects API collection when API credentials are configured and otherwise falls back to local browser collection with a persistent dedicated Chromium profile.

Load `references/x-twitter-digest.md` when you need implementation details, browser workflow rules, current-run context behavior, or the scoring rubric.

## Data Collection

There are three collection scripts:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/browser_x_digest.py   # browser collector
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/api_x_digest.py       # API collector
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py   # upper wrapper, --source auto
```

For chat usage, run the wrapper:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py
```

`run_daily_digest.py --source auto` uses `X_BEARER_TOKEN` / `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN` when present; otherwise it uses the browser collector. Browser mode is still required for X Chat / DM content unless a read-DM-capable API integration is configured.

Force a source:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --source browser
X_BEARER_TOKEN=... python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --source api --handle <handle>
```

The first run opens a dedicated browser profile at `twitter-digest/.state/chrome-profile`. The user logs in to X once in that browser. Later runs default to headless collection and reuse the saved local browser session. If the saved login is unavailable, the script automatically opens a visible browser window for manual login.

DM reading is enabled by default and only reads visible local browser content. To skip DMs for a run:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --no-dms
```

Default scope:

- Mentions of the authenticated handle.
- Home timeline hotspots.
- Own profile activity.
- Today's visible DM conversations, with only conversations whose latest preview is not from the user opened for content.
- Optional keyword searches only when the user explicitly passes `--keywords`.

Public timeline/profile/mentions pages use the same daily-window loading model as DMs: by default the collector scrolls each public page up to 40 rounds, keeps up to 300 public items, and stops early when loaded post timestamps show content beyond the 24-hour digest window (`--scrolls 40`, `--max-public-items 300`, `--public-window-hours 24`).

Read only `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-context.md` when writing the Chinese digest. Its `Final Summary Facts` section is the content source for the final summary. Use `digest-input.md` only when debugging collection issues, not during normal summarization. Do not add content from older runs.

## Install

From the repository `skills/` directory:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/install.py
```

Default install copies the skill to `~/.claude/skills/twitter-digest`. Local development can use `--symlink`.

The installer checks for Python 3.10+ and a supported Chromium browser before installing. Supported browsers are Google Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft Edge, and Brave. If the browser will be installed later, use `--skip-browser-check`.

The installer moves old `twitter-briefing`, `twitter-briefing.bak`, or existing `twitter-digest` installs into `~/.claude/skills/.backups/` and disables their `SKILL.md` files so Claude Code does not load duplicate old skills. It does not copy `.state` from the development checkout.

Claude Code or other agents can use the installed skill by running the same browser scripts.

## Run Outputs

`scripts/run_daily_digest.py` does not write long-term memory. Each run writes only current-run files:

- `twitter-digest/.state/config.json`: account defaults and preferences.
- `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-context.md`: the only normal input for AI daily-summary writing.
- `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-context.json`: machine-readable version of the same normalized facts.
- `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-input.md`: raw collector capture for debugging only.
- `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-input.json`: raw machine-readable collector capture for debugging only.

No `memory.json` or `daily/` archive is produced. Raw DM text or DM excerpts may exist only in the current run's private `twitter-digest/.state/run/digest-input.*` and `digest-context.*` files for immediate summarization/debugging. The run directory is created with owner-only permissions where supported. Run dates use the user's local timezone.

## Workflow

### 1. Collect

When the user asks for an X daily digest or X 日报, run:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py
```

If they ask to skip DMs:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --no-dms
```

If the authenticated handle is not detected or the user corrects it:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --handle <handle> --account-name "<显示名>" --save-default
```

For debugging or manual inspection:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --headed
```

For unattended scheduled runs that should not block on passcode recovery:

```bash
python3 twitter-digest/scripts/run_daily_digest.py --non-interactive
```

Do not ask the user to copy cookies or configure another service. If the script opens a visible browser window, tell the user to log in or resolve the visible X challenge there.

### 2. Protect Privacy

Treat browser sessions, cookies observed internally by the script, DMs, phone numbers, emails, private handles, and screenshots as sensitive. Do not post, reply, like, follow, block, open suspicious links, accept DM requests, or send DMs unless the user explicitly asks after reviewing a draft.

Browser DM collection only reads message content visible in the logged-in local browser. If X Chat shows a passcode setup, passcode entry, or end-to-end-encryption recovery screen during headless collection, the script should automatically reopen X Messages in a visible browser window, wait for the user to complete it, then retry DM collection. In `--non-interactive` mode, record the DM data gap and continue without blocking. Do not choose, enter, or store a passcode for the user.

### 3. Analyze

Group mentions by reason to care:

- Direct asks: questions, requests, invitations, support requests.
- Influence: high-signal accounts or high engagement.
- Risk: complaints, misinformation, scams, impersonation, security-sensitive posts.
- Opportunity: partnership, hiring, customer lead, investor/media attention, community praise.
- Noise: spam, generic tags, low-context reposts.

Classify DMs as:

- `urgent`: time-sensitive, business-critical, safety/security, money, reputation, or deadline.
- `important`: meaningful relationship, opportunity, unresolved issue, or action needed.
- `routine`: informational, friendly, low-risk, or easy acknowledgement.
- `ignore`: spam, phishing, harassment, or irrelevant bulk outreach.

Always report DM conversation counts and message counts separately when available. Conversation counts come from today's X Chat list items only: today visible conversations, conversations whose latest preview is from the user (`You:` / `You sent` / `你:`), and conversations waiting for the user's reply. Older conversations visible in the list are ignored for the daily count. Message counts come only from opened waiting-reply conversations and represent captured message bubbles. The collector now tries to load each opened waiting-reply conversation completely by scrolling upward until the browser reaches the thread top; defaults are a 200-scroll safety limit and up to 2000 kept message bubbles (`--dm-scrolls 200`, `--dm-max-messages 2000`, `--dm-window-hours 0`). If a thread does not reach the top or hits the message cap, the digest context records a `dm_thread_incomplete` data gap. Only summarize DM bodies from `dm_status: captured_unreplied_threads`. If today's visible conversations all have latest previews from the user, report `no_unreplied_threads` as “今天可见私信会话最后一条都是我发出的，无需处理”, not “没有私信”. If `no_today_threads` appears, say there were visible older conversations but no today conversations. If `visible_threads_unopened` appears, say the conversation list was visible but waiting-reply message bodies were not opened.

For waiting-reply DMs, still summarize selectively. Count all waiting-reply conversations, but only include DMs with action value, relationship value, risk, money/security implications, or clear user relevance in the digest. Obvious spam, phishing, generic promotion, low-context links, or repeated junk should be counted and classified as ignore/noise without copying the content into the main summary.

For DM sender attribution, use the thread `participant` / `会话对象` and message bubble direction. Do not treat authors inside quoted posts, repost cards, link previews, or embedded tweet text as the DM sender. If a DM contains a shared post by `Marco` inside a conversation with `@jerry`, the DM is from the conversation participant, not from `Marco`.

When `digest-context.md` includes `### DM Thread Context`, use that section to understand the recent conversation history for waiting-reply DMs. It may include up to 2000 loaded message bubbles per summarized thread, plus raw thread label, URL, and load metadata, so the model can understand complex context before deciding whether and how to mention the DM. Keep the final digest concise; do not paste the full DM history into the report.

Use media and link metadata when present. Public items and DM message context may include `media`, `link`, and `card` lines with image/video URLs, alt text, shared-post links, and external links. Treat these as context for understanding the item, but do not open suspicious links or overstate image contents beyond the available alt/text/URL signals.

For private messages, summarize minimally. Quote only the short phrase needed to justify classification, and omit sensitive personal data unless the user specifically needs it.

### 4. Produce The Daily Summary

除非用户另有要求，最终输出必须用中文，并使用这个结构：

```markdown
## 🐦 X 日报 - YYYY-MM-DD

**📌 今日总结**
用 2-4 句中文先给判断：今天最值得知道的事、是否有需要处理的风险/机会、建议用户怎么做。

**✅ 该处理**
| 优先级 | 来自 | 为什么重要 | 建议动作 |
|---|---|---|---|

**◆ 谁 @ 了你**
- 🔴 值得回 / 需要处理
- 🟡 一般互动
- ⚪ 噪音折叠统计

**◆ 私信（DM）**
- 会话统计：今日可见会话 N 个，最后我发出 N 个，等我回复 N 个
- 消息统计：已打开等我回复会话中捕获消息 N 条
- 仅挑重点总结等我回复的私信；垃圾、钓鱼、低质营销只计数并归为忽略
- 🔴 重要 / 🟡 一般 / ⚪ 忽略

**◆ 时间线热点**
1. 热点：一句话解释 + 代表观点 + 和用户的关系

**◆ 你的动态**
- 近 24h 自己发帖/互动概况

**✍️ 建议回复草稿**
- 只给草稿，不自动发送。

**⚠️ 数据缺口**
- 哪些页面没读到、DM 是否不可见、是否只扫描了前 N 条。
```

保持简洁、有判断、可执行。价值在总结和行动建议，不是把页面内容全文搬运。
